# gnome-control-center-x11-scaling

gnome-control-center build with Ubuntu patches for Xorg fractional scaling on Manjaro / Arch Linux.

This package requires [mutter-x11-scaling](https://github.com/puxplaying/mutter-x11-scaling) to work.

Applied patches are for proper multi-monitor management and a toggle to enable/disable fractional scaling.
